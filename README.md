## Talk To Your Home Basic Workshop

The **"Talk To Your Home Basic Workshop "** is an explorative 12-15 hours workshop made by Davide Gomba and the Casa Jasmina Team in late Autumn 2017, aimed to create the referral documentation to the creation of a domotic home based on the student needs.

The setup features:

* Basic [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/) _applets_ or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)'s' _zaps_
* [Blynk](http://www.blynk.cc/) tests
* a Basic [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) Setup based on custom or OEM components, such as Arduino MKR1000 or Wemos D1.
